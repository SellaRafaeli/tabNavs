Questions:
- let's build a nested navigator
- why does it sometimes crash?
- how to inspect elements? OM? 
- intro to x-code (like fuzzy-search for files)
- run the practice app (miising RCTRootView.h?)
- add icons 
- download example and run it, e.g.: https://github.com/oblador/react-native-vector-icons/blob/master/Examples/TabBarExample/index.ios.js
- when I try to call 'PostsList' component from SinglePost (instead of calling another SinglePost) it doesn't work? But if I pass in the reference it does?
- Running Chrome debug tools, 'require' doesn't seem to work?
